# Hi, I’m Pawan Kalyan (Cintu07)

I build things that people can actually use — web apps, AI integrations, and automations. I’m an Electronics & Communication Engineering student who likes moving fast, shipping MVPs, and iterating based on real feedback.

What I do
- Build full-stack web apps (React + Node) and APIs
- Integrate AI (OpenAI, Claude, LangChain) to add smart features
- Automate workflows using n8n, Make, Zapier and low-code tools
- Prototype fast with FlutterFlow, Bubble, and serverless backends

Tech
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, MySQL
- AI & Automation: OpenAI, Claude, Deepgram, LangChain, Vapi, Retell AI, n8n, Make, Zapier
- No-code / Low-code: FlutterFlow, Bubble, Xano, Airtable, GHL, HubSpot
- Cloud & Integrations: Pinecone, Twilio, Supabase, Firebase
- Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript
- Systems & Concepts: Unix/Linux, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, TCP/IP
- Education/Experience: Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience

Projects
- Aptitude Practice Platform — https://pawanaptitude.netlify.app (AI hints, quick practice)
- DSA Practice Platform — https://pawandsa.netlify.app (multi-language solutions, interactive practice)

Highlights
- Built my first full platform in 5 days using AI tools and rapid deployment
- Prefer short feedback loops: build, ship, learn, repeat
